PyTorch is a machine learning library for the programming language Python, based on the [Torch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torch_(machine_learning)) library, used for applications such as deep learning and natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's artificial-intelligence research group, and Uber's [Pyro probabilistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming) programming language software is built on it. An open source deep learning platform that provides a seamless path from research prototyping to production deployment.

**PyTorch provides two high-level features:**
- Tensor computing (like NumPy) with strong acceleration via graphics processing units (GPU)
- Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autodiff system
